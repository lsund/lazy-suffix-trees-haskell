**** Vary words with synonyms if possible.
**** Each paragraph explains one thing. First sentence summarizes it
**** What would the header for this paragraph be?
**** 3-4 paragraphs per page.
**** If the paragraphs are floating on nicely, don't use transitions
*** Transitions between paragraphs
**** But, however, on the other hand, yet
**** For example, that is
**** similarly, moreover, furthermore, in addition
**** Therefore, consequently, as a result, thus
**** Then, after that, ultimately

**** Less is more
**** DRY
**** Do not use too much technical terms or cliche's
**** Don't over-explain the basics, don't be over-enthustiastic
**** Assume reader is of academic background with vague interest in the subject.
**** Stay disconnected from the work, not personal.
**** Dont overstate the ideas. Use arguably, possibly etc
**** Make every word and every sentence count
*** Specific words
**** Considered {as, to be} -> considered
**** Dont begin sentences with also
**** Data is -> Data are
**** Media is -> Media are
**** Each is singular
**** Every is singular
**** Methology is the study or the system of methods. use method
**** Limit 'Plus' to mathematic
**** Unique means one of a kind, not special/unusual
**** Since is always followed by a specific date description
**** Continual - happening again and again
**** Continuous - happening all the time without stopping
**** Farther - physical distance
**** Further - metaphorical distance
**** Among - more than 2 things
**** Between - 2 things

*** Punctuation
**** No periods for list of items, unless items are sentences
**** No periods in headings, titles of figures, caption of figures, adresses
**** When commas occur inside the element of a series, semicolons should be used
**** Comma follows:
***** Namely
***** that is
***** i.e.
***** e.g.
***** for example
**** Comma does not follow:
***** but
***** or
***** unless
**** Semicolon marks a greater break in the sentence than comma
**** Color marks a greater berak in the sentence than semicolon
**** Dash makes a sudden interruption in the sentence-flow
**** Quotation:
***** Jamies's -> Jamies'
***** They took their SAT's -> They took their SATs
**** Comma and period go inside quotation mark. Colon/semicolon go outside

** How to solve it
*** The list
**** Understanding the problem
***** Preliminaries
****** What is the Unknown?
****** What is the data?
****** What is the condition?
***** Can we solve the problem?
****** Is it possible to satisfy the condition?
****** Is the condition sufficent to determine the unknown?
****** Is it insufficient?
****** Is it redundant?
***** Draw a figure
****** Introduce suitable notation
***** Separate various parts of the contition
****** Write the separate parts down
**** Devising a plan
***** Find the connection between the data and the unknown
***** Consider auxillary problems if an immidiate solution can not be found
****** Have you seen the problem before?
****** Have you seen the same problem in a slightly different setting?
****** Do you know a related problem?
****** Do you know a useful theorem?
***** Look at the unknown!
****** Try to think of similar problems that have the same unknown.
***** Here is a problem related to you and solved before. Can you use it?
****** Can you use its method?
****** Can you introduce an auxillary element to make its use possible?
***** Can you restate the problem?
****** Can you restate it again?
***** Go back to definitions
***** If you cannot solve the problem, try solving an related problem.
****** Can you think of a more accesible related problem?
****** A more general problem?
****** A more special problem?
****** An analogous problem?
****** Can you solve a part of the problem?
***** Keep only part of the condition, drop the other. How far is the unknown then determined?
****** How can it vary?
***** Can you Derive something useful from the data?
****** Could you think of any other appropriate data to determine the unknown?
****** Could you change the unknown or the data or both so that the new unknown and data are nearer eachother?
****** Did you use all the data? Did you use the whole condition?
****** Have you taken into account the different notions involved?
**** Carrying out the plan
***** Check each step
****** Can you see that each step is correct?
****** Can you prove it?
**** Looking back
**** Can you check the result?
**** Can you check the argument?
**** Can you derive the result in a different way?
**** Can you see it now at a glance?
**** Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
*** General pointers
**** The hardest part of researching a problem is understanding precisely what the problem says
**** When teaching something, ask the same questions as the audiance would.
**** Good ideas are based on past experience
**** Solving a problem:
    Begin with a general question of the list. Proceed gradually to more specific and
    more concrete questions that have to provoke a response.
*** The procedure
**** 1. Start with the problem statement
    Visualize the problem as clearly and vividly as you can. Do not consider details
    at this time. Memorize the problem statement. Isolate the principal parts of the
    problem. Consider the principal parts one by one in isolation and in combinations.
***** For problems to prove:
     Principal parts are Hypothesis and conclusion
***** For problems to find:
     Principal parts are Unkown, data and conditions
**** 2. Think about the details of your problem
    Consider the problem from various view points and cosider prior
    knowledge about the problem. Consider the details in different
    orders or combinations. Try to find some meaning or new
    interpretation in every detail. Think about what helped in
    situations in the past. Be greatful for new ideas or solidified
    knowledge. Follow up on incomplete ideas if they seem useful. Two
    questions might be easier to answer than one provided that they
    are intelligently connected.
**** 3. Carry out the plan
    Compose and decompose the steps if they are too big. When one step
    is solved, try to make it shorter, clearer or more usable.
