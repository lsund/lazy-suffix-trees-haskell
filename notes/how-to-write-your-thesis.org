* Research
** General
*** Where is the research data coming from?
**** Doctronic?
**** Past article benchmarking data?
*** Appendix 14 can help with research
*** Need to clarify and formulate research problem
*** What is data in my case?
**** Prior knowledge about
***** Theory
***** Algorithms
***** efficiency
***** Test strings
*** Use secondary data before collecting real world data
*** Analyze the data
*** Topic must pose a buseness problem, issues and challanges.
*** Research questions must be measurable in practice
*** Hypothesis
*** Research problem should be
**** Interesting
**** Important
**** Precise and well-delimited
**** Feasable
**** Stretching your skills
**** Well defined audience
**** Answerable, with a useful answer
**** Capable of producing clear business reccomendations
**** Able to provide follow-up opportunities for you after graduation
*** Thesis must have focus on a limited topic
** The 5 phases
*** Phase 1: Research Problem and Research Question verification
