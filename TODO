check that each character is at most 2 characters

updating suffix trees if you know the data that changed

Plot graph with text size / memory

Might be good to represent nodes near root by hash table etc while later with
linked lists

Pattern contains three special characters: \8211 and \8212 for "long" dashes,
\8209 for a short dash.

Instead of sorting: Process the list once and add to a map of char -> Edge

Does not find some patterns, eg KartVerg 05 / 99. Seems to be a problem when
they only exist within <Tags> but on the other hands finds others so I'm not
really sure
